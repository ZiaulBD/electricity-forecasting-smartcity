# Electricity Forecasting for Smart City Energy Management

This project analyzes and forecasts hourly electricity demand in Hungary using Python.  
It aims to support smart city infrastructure with data-driven energy planning.

## 📊 Project Goals

- Visualize electricity usage patterns over time
- Analyze daily and hourly consumption trends
- Apply a 24-hour moving average forecast for short-term load prediction
- Demonstrate practical data skills for energy/smart grid applications

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Google Colab
- Time-series analysis
- GitHub for version control

## 📁 Dataset

Synthetic dataset generated based on realistic hourly usage patterns.

## 🔍 Insights

- Electricity demand rises sharply during mornings and evenings
- Weekends show slightly lower overall demand
- Moving average helps smooth out noise and forecast upcoming demand trends

## 👨‍💼 Relevance

This project is aligned with smart city energy optimization, demand-side planning, and grid load balancing — all crucial in modern power systems.
